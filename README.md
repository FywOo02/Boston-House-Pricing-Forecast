## Project Description
- This is a Boston house price prediction project based on the scikit-learn library. It is very friendly for newbies to machine learning, easy to get started, and doesn't have a lot of dirty data to work with. The core of the project is a regression problem, where we need to find potential relationships between feature values and target values in past data (experience), and use algorithms from different models to fit a function that best fits the house price trend and apply it to future predictions.

## Properties
- Based on the ordinary linear regression model, we tried cross-sectional optimization to explore the prediction of ridge regression and LASSO regression for the dataset prediction.
- Analyze the correlation between various characteristics and house prices, and the referenceability of the data. After conducting several comparison experiments, we finally found and tuned the Gradient Boosting Regressor model that can make the function fit up to 92%.
